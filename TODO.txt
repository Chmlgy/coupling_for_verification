TODO:   t-NI & t-SNI formulations via couplings
        `off-diagonal entries = 0` as an additional equation set for LP (might make it faster)
        multiple inputs should be supported (this is trickier than one might think)
        maximizing the sum along the diagonal gives information on how much leakage is present
            (if it is 0, the secret can be fully obtained through algebraic operations on the probe set)
            (if it is <1, the secret can be obtained through differential analysis)
            (this idea should be formally further studied)
        read off from an SSA program file (or a Verilog file) for comfort
        try all possible probe sets to complete the method
            afterwards: `topological` sort on possible probes for a speed up
        
        the Monge formulation for the initial coupling over the randomness spaces might be enough
        complementing the rewrite tools by picking off where they cannot simplify any further could be a plausible direction

misc.:  polytopes for counting solutions in the linear case (might not occur frequently in practice)
        considering arithmetic masking over a given field
        glitch and transition resistance as an important modification to the model

next week (15/12):
        decipher the verilog code (ask Tolun Hoca)
        parse it with `pyverilog`
        try to run our code with it
        try to run maskverif on it
            ditch the registers
        write the proof for Kantorovich => Monge
        experiment with Kantorovich vs Monge
        fix the code
        Monge is enough for no leakage, but for leakage, maybe Kantorovich?
